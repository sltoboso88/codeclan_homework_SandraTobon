Clean Oscars Table

The dimensions of the original table are: rows 441, columns 27

The columns _golden, _unit_state, _trusted_judgments and _last_judgment_at
are the result for a computational modeling that try to try to identify if the
award was deserved or not. In this case we decide don't use it.

Also this table have some columns with the name confidence that are the
confidence interval analysis about the data, so we don't need them for making
the shiny project.

The columns that finish with _gold are result of the modeling and we don't need
for this project.

We separate the column place of birth so in this way we could have the
information about the city, state and country and we clean some miss data
because in the case of United States of America we have only the city and state
and we don't have country, some data have only the country and city so we had to
move this data from state to country
